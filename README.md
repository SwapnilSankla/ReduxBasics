# ReduxBasics

Simple application written to understand how redux works

Dependencies: Redux

Framework used to run: node

Why redux:
For managing state in complex applications.

App explores:
1. Creating simple store.
2. Reducers and combineReducers. With rules for using combineReducers. 

Limitations:
1. Redux does not guarantee immutability. Would need Immutable.js to make state object immutable.
